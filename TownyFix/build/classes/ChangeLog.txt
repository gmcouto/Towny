	Changed the debug output for when permissions are checked against as it might be causing confusing.
	Quick fix for /tc and /nc with no msg.
	Ingame Resident/Town/Nation/Global messages are now sent to it's own log file. It's nature is to start a new log every time the plugin is enabled. Due to the nature of the backup system, it will now keep the log of what went on during that time period.
	Compiled against Permissions 2.5, to see if it makes any difference.
	Added maximum plots per resident globally (default=1000). Anyone trying to claim more than this will get an error.

	Switch perms were outputting incorrectly.
	Item use are now included in item ids usable in the wild.
	The permission, towny.wild.block.[item id] is now towny.wild.block.[item id].[action], where [action] is build, destroy, switch, item_use. So just add .* onto the end to function normally.
	No longer attempts to tax when using_iconomy=false.
	Added support for Questioner (A simple manager for asking questions).
		'/town add' will go through it to ask the player instead of immediately adding the player if installed.
	Possible bugfix?
